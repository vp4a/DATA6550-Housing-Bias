# DATA6550-Housing-Bias

This project investigates how historic housing discrimination in Minnesota's racial covenenant areas continues to influence modern mortgage lending through data and algorithmic bias. We use data from the Mapping Prejudice Project to analyze property values, approval rates, and risk assessment criteria to ID potential biases in order to understand how injustices of the past effect decision-making of today, and to propose potential mitigation strategies to increase fairness in lending.
